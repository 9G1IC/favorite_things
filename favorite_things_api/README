#Usage:
	To add a new favorite: /addFavorite
	To update a favorite item: /updateFavorite/#
	To view all favorites: /favorites
	To add a new category: /addCategory
	To view all categories: /categories 
	
#Setup development environment
	1. virtualenv favorite_things
	2. pip install "all dependencies"
	3. create project and app 
	4. create git repo and commit
	5. create and checkout development branch

#Environment	
	1. OS 		    - Linux 4.20.0-042000-generic, Ubuntu 18.04 
	2. Server Framework - Django
	3. Backend Database - Postgres 10
	4. ORM 		    - Django
	5. Deployment	    - PythonAnywhere
	6. Python 	    - v 3.6.8
	

#Plan: I am using the Out-In development style
	1. Getting a good frontend in bootstrap. I am not familiar with Vue.js (Better with Angularjs)
	2. Creating migrations to test frontend, using db.sqlit3 for now
 	3. Setting up Django Rest Framework using Viewset, and routers.
		pip install djangorestframework djangorestframework-hstore(for meta data)
		Added rest_serializer.py and rest_views.py
	4. Preliminary test with ipython before pytest
	5. Adding forms
	6. Testing

#Deployment:
	I am using Pythonanywhere as my deployment platform because, my AWS account is expired, and I am unable to re-activate it at the moment


##What could not complete:
1. The UI/UX still needs some styling
2. The default categories of Person,Food, and Place
3. The deployment on AWS. I could not get an account due to credit card issues
4. I used bootstrap instead of Vue.js
